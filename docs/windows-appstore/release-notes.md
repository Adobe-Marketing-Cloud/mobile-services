## Current Release Notes

In addition to significant performance increases, version 4 adds the following new features:

| Feature | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Geo-location - Points of Interest|Points of interest let you set up a lat/long central point and determine a radius. The library then determines if the location provided for that call falls within any of your points of interest. For more information, see *Geo-location & Points of Interest* in [Analytics](/docs/windows-appstore/analytics/analytics.md).|
|Lifetime Value|Lifetime value is a way to measure your users’ contributions and usage in your app. Each time you send in a value it will add to that user’s existing value.  For more information, see *Lifetime Value* in [Analytics](/docs/windows-appstore/analytics/analytics.md).|
|Timed Action|Timed Actions are an easy way for you see how long it takes your users to complete a process end-to-end within your app. Timed actions let you calculate the amount of time in session and the total time (cross-session) it takes for the action to be completed. For more information, see *Timed Actions* in [Analytics](/docs/windows-appstore/analytics/analytics.md).|
|Opt-in/Opt-out|Quickly enable and disable analytics.|
