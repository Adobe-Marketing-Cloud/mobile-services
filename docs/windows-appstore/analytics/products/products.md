# Products variable

The products variable cannot be set using processing rules. In the mobile SDK, you must use a special syntax within the context data parameter to set products directly on the server call.

To set the *`products`* variable, set a context data key to `"&&products"`, and set the value using the syntax defined for the *`products`*:

```js
cdata["&&products"] = "Category;Product;Quantity;Price[,Category;Product;Quantity;Price]";
```

For example:

```js
//create a context data dictionary 
var cdata = new Windows.Foundation.Collections.PropertySet(); 
 
// add products, a purchase id, a purchase context data key, and any other data you want to collect. 
// Note the special syntax for products 
cdata["&&products"] = ";Running Shoes;1;69.95,;Running Socks;10;29.99"; 
cdata["m.purchaseid"] = "1234567890"; 
cdata["m.purchase"] = "1"; 
 
var ADB = ADBMobile; 
// send the tracking call - use either a trackAction or TrackState call. 
// trackAction example: 
ADB.Analytics.trackAction("purchase", cdata); 
// trackState example: 
ADB.Analytics.trackState("Order Confirmation", cdata);
```

*`products`* is set directly on the image request, and the other variables are set as context data. All context data variables must be mapped using processing rules:

You do not need to map the *`products`* variable using processing rules since it is set directly on the image request by the SDK.
