# Override the ADBMobile JSON config path

You can load a different ADBMobile JSON config file when the application starts.

The `Config.overrideConfigStream(configInput)` method allows you to specify the path to a different `ADBMobile.json` configuration file when the application starts. This method must be called before any other Experience Cloud SDK call (before `Config.collectLifecycleData()` ), typically in the `onCreate` method of your first loaded activity.

Calling this method with a different path causes a one-time override of the configuration file until the application is closed.

```java
 try { 
   InputStream configInput = getAssets().open("ExampleJSONFile.json"); 
   Config.overrideConfigStream(configInput); 
   } catch (IOException ex) { 
   // do something with the exception if needed 
}
```
